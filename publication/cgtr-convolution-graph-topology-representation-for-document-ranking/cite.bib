abstract = {Contextualized neural language models have gained much attention in Information Retrieval
(IR) with its ability to achieve better text understanding by capturing contextual
structure. However, to achieve better document understanding, it is necessary to involve
global structure of a document. In this paper, we take the advantage of Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCN) to model global word-relation structure of a document to improve context-aware
document ranking. We propose to build a graph for a document to model the global structure.
The nodes and edges of the graph are constructed from contextual embeddings. Then
we apply graph convolution on the graph to learning a new representation, and this
representation covers both contextual and global structure information. The experimental
results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual language
models, which demonstrate that incorporating global structure is useful for improving
document ranking and GCN is an effective way to achieve it.},
